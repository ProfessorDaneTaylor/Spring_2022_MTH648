Homework 0 will train us to use organize our code, document it, and use GitHub.

Our documentation is here:
https://spring-2022-mth648.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

For help on documentation with Sphinx and Read the docs, see:

NOTE: First, download a .zip file of copy of the github folder, and complete the above assignments locally on your computer. As you complete each task, upload the appropriate file to github.




Your assignment is to:

1. Create a new python file that is similar to the following file:
 
 'danes_module.py'

It should use your name and contain two functions that you've created.
Make 2 different functions and make sure they work!
Give them a descriptive name.
Push your file to Github into the folder:

 'code'

2. Modify the Jupiter notebook:

 'notebooks/HW0_MTH648.ipynb'

that is in the folder 'notebooks' so that it
(2a) loads your module. Use a line similar to 

 'from danes_module import *'

(2b) then show that your functions work.
Push HW0_MTH648.ipynb to Github into the folder

 'notebooks'

and replace the file that was there (i.e., which you downloaded).

3. Create a documentation file similar to

 'danes_documentation.rst'

But that uses your name.
Push your file to Github into the folder

 'docs' 

4. In the file 

 'docs/source/index.html'

add a line that names your documentation filename under the line 17, which states

 '   danes_documentation'

Then push your file to GitHub, replacing file 'docs/source/index.html'.
